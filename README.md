# XinuOS-ProcessMgmt
This Project on Xinu OS design focuses on process management and stack handling. It involves coding tasks like cascading termination for user processes and implementing a Unix-style `fork` system call. The project enhances understanding of Xinu's codebase, process creation, and testing through practical coding and comprehensive test cases.
